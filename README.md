Overall, my program utilizes the four ideas of Object Oriented Programming. It utilizes encapsulation by way of the ThingList class, in which the method Node is a private class that is encapsulated by ThingList and therefore can only be used by ThingList. I use information hiding by making the main integers and chars in Thing protected so that they can only be used by TypeA, TypeB, and TypeC and no other methods can utilize. I also have private methods in ThingList such as toString() that can only be accessed by the printAll() method. I use inheritance by making Thing an abstract class and having TypeA, TypeB, and TypeC child classes that inherit from thing. Finally, I use polymorhpism by way of my ThingList. Methods such as add initially call for a Thing, but this thing can be recalled as TypeA, TypeB, or TypeC when actually being added to the Queue.
